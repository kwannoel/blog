        <h1>Why Another Blog?</h1>
        </header>
    <p>
      The move to a new format is largely inspired by
      <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu's Site</a>.
      Importantly, the design is functional and minimal,
      and emphasis is placed on polished and in-depth writing.
      That to me is the most important aspect of blog tooling,
      there must be little friction between a writer and their writing,
      so their thoughts can flow without interruption.
      </p>
    <p>
      I had two previous blogs,
      <a href="https://github.com/kwannoel/mind">kwannoel.xyz</a>
      and
      <a href="https://kwannoel.github.io/thoughts/">Thoughts</a>.
      Both of these are Static Site Generators (SSGs),
      which ingest Markdown files
      and output HTML, CSS and JS.
      These add overhead, despite
      being relatively simple to use.
      Previously, I wanted a common tool for both blogging and note-taking,
      so a tool like Neuron made sense.
      But I no longer have this requirement.
      So it means incurring the overhead
      of SSGs. I have to maintain scripts to publish the site,
      am required to structure the repository in a special way to separate
      rendered artifacts from the source,
      and need to setup and maintain the toolchain per machine I use.
      Moving forward, I will use vanilla HTML,
      CSS and JS, so it is simple to maintain my blog,
      since there is no extra toolchain required,
      and the source artifact is the same as the published artifact,
      </p>
    <p>
      If you look into the articles in my previous blogs,
      they intentionally contained short-form content,
      instead of something more fleshed out.
      This was because previously I felt writing was a chore,
      whereas note-taking was more of a natural routine.
      So I wrote shorter pieces as a gateway into blogging,
      to get started on the habit.
      Nowadays it's the other way around,
      where I really want to write in-depth pieces. Writing deeper articles
      with focus on fundamentals makes the concept more interesting,
      since there's an "Aha!" moment when you connect the dots,
      and start seeing overlaps between different fundamental concepts.
      I also write for an audience,
      since I intrinsically enjoy sharing ideas and
      discussing them with others. Common ground is easier to establish when
      talking about the same thing (fundamentals),
      and you keep your audience engaged.
      </p>
    <p>
      An added bonus is that I will get to experiment with vanilla HTML, CSS and
      JS (and perhaps WASM?), since I'm no longer shackled by the requirements
      of my SSG framework.
      I always wanted to do things like embedded browser games,
      esoteric frontend designs. Perhaps now I will.
      </p>
    <p>That's all, hope you will enjoy reading my new blog.</p>
