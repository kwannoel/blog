        <h1>Why Can't My Web Server Running in Docker be Reached?</h1>
        </header>
    <p>
      A user sent feedback that they couldn't connect to
      <a href="https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/">
        RisingWave's standalone mode</a>
      when using docker.
      The error was:
      <pre>
        > psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 4566
        psql: error: connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 4566 failed: Connection refused
            Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
        </pre>
      </p>

    <p>
      For context, RisingWave is a
      <a href="https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/">
        Streaming Database</a>,
      and standalone mode is just a deployment mode of RisingWave,
      where all services of RisingWave are embedded in a single process.
      The RisingWave Cluster has a Frontend service which
      deals with client requests,
      and the service listens to <code>127.0.0.1:4566</code> by default.

      That was a little strange since we would run the tests on the binary
      daily in CI, and nothing was flagged since the last version update.
      I then realized that in CI and locally,
      we executed the process on the host machine,
      instead of within a container,
      so this difference was likely the cause.

      We checked the docker logs, and the server was definitely running.
      So what else could be the error? It must be the connection between
      the host machine and the frontend node running in the docker container,
      which means it was a network issue.
      First I checked the Docker Configurations
      to see if the ports were exposed.
      The port mapping was fine, the container did had the port mapping: <code>-p 4566:4566</code>.
      Next, I looked at the frontend node's listening socket.
      It listened to <code>127.0.0.1:4566</code> by default.
      It seemed like the explanation was that the socket
      was somehow not reachable from the outside.
      I had a hunch that listening at the adress <code>0.0.0.0</code>
      could work instead,
      because I recalled that means it would listen on ALL network interfaces.
      With this change, we finally we got the client to connect.

      So how does routing to docker exactly happen?
      We know that the routing path from the host machine to docker should
      be static.
      That's because we just changed to server's address, we did not
      tweak anything else.
      So the first question is, how does Docker setup the routing tables
      such that requests to 127.0.0.1 actually get routed to it?
      </p>

      <pre>
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES

      </pre>

      We see 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp. What does that mean? Does curling 127.0.0.1 somehow change the destination address?

      <pre>
> $ sudo iptables -L DOCKER -n -v
Chain DOCKER (1 references)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 ACCEPT     6    --  !docker0 docker0  0.0.0.0/0            172.17.0.2           tcp dpt:8080
    0     0 ACCEPT     6    --  !docker0 docker0  0.0.0.0/0            172.17.0.3           tcp dpt:8080
      </pre>

      Seems like there can be multiple paths for ip tables.
      Basically all source requests get translated to these two destination addresses.
